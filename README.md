### Import External Libraries

- **Usage**: `IMP: N_: System`, `IMP: N_: System.IO`, etc.
- **Description**: Import external namespaces and libraries into your Opeico code, extending its functionality with predefined classes and functions.

### Define Classes and Methods

- **Usage**: `DOMAIN MainClass`, `DOMAIN MyMethod()`, etc.
- **Description**: Define classes and methods as fundamental building blocks for code structure, encapsulating data and behavior.

### String Manipulation

- **Usage**: `?{"Hello, World!"}@`, `?{"Result: " + result}@".
- **Description**: Easily work with text and data by using double-quoted strings and concatenating variables and expressions.

### Exception Handling

- **Usage**: `$t_ { ... } $c_ { ... }`.
- **Description**: Implement robust error management with "Try" and "Catch" blocks, ensuring your code handles exceptions gracefully.

### Math Integration

- **Usage**: `result Kind 10 / 2`, `sum Kind a Kind b`, etc.
- **Description**: Perform mathematical operations with ease, inspired by languages like R and Python, using standard arithmetic operators.
  
### the "RUN" Keyword
- **Usage**: `RUN myVariable Kind 42`
- **Description**: In Opeico, the "RUN" keyword is used for variable declaration and assignment. You can declare and initialize variables using "RUN" followed by the variable name, "Kind," and the initial value.
